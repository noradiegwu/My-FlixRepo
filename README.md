## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  The main challenge I had was figuring out what the errors Android Studio was throwing meant and how to fix them. Fixing them, once I knew the problem, included Googling, asking neighbors/instructors for help, and investigating Android Studio's suggestions. 

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - Image loading and caching library for Android
